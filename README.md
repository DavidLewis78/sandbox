# sandbox
A playground for the team to practice some Git skills.

There are 3 exercises to complete. For each exercise: check out the branch in question, make your own version of the branch with your name appended (e.g. Scenario1_David ), apply the necessary fixes, push your branch then create a pull request on github.

Scenario1: The developer of the Scenario1 branch has completed their work, but has merge conflicts with master. Make a copy of this branch and fix the error by rebasing against master.

Scenario2: The developer of Scenario2_B branch has a dependency in Scenario2_A. Make a copy of Scenario2_B and bring over the needed commit only using cherrypick.

Scenario3: The developer of this branch has two redundant commits in their history, and theyâ€™ve made a typo on the remaining commit message. Drop the redundant commits and reword the commit message with the typo in it using an interactive rebase.
